					People coming to terms with their gender identity or sexuality can feel very isolated. Meeting people who have been through a similar experience can be a helpful first step and really take a weight off. Many students contact the society hoping to find someone who understands what they're going through, and we do everything we can to help.

					We'll typically invite you to meet one of us in Preston so that we can get to know you and understand your situation. The LGBT* umbrella is broad and sometimes our experiences are different. If you feel you'd get more out of speaking to somoene more relatable, we're happy to find a member of the society who's better suited. That doesn't mean you're on your own from there though - we'll keep in touch and make sure things are okay.

					There are some problems that we can't overcome on our own. We're really just students. When we're out of our depth, we hand over to the <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/students/health/counselling/">professional staff</a> at UCLan. Mental illness (often in the form of depression or anxiety) is not uncommon in LGBT* people, and UCLan offers support for people suffering from these conditions.
